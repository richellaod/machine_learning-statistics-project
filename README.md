# Machine Learning & Statistics Project 2019

This assessment concerns the well known Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras and jupyter and is broken down into the below 3 parts:

*Create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Proces dataset.
*In this jupyter notebook, add a section where inferential statistics are used to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and houses that are not.
*Use keras to create a neutral network that can predict the median house price based on the other variable in the dataset.
